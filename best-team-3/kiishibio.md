# Hello

My name is Abooluwakiishi Akande but I go by Kiishi.

I am a 21 year old university student currently studying Electronics. I speak
English and basic Dutch and French. I live in Mechelen and school in
Sint-Katelijne-Waver I love swimming, reading fictional books and listening to
conversational podcasts.
